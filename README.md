## :dollar: The Project 
The purpose of this project is to be a dashboard that allows users to manage their monthly earnings and expenses. 
For this, several graphs are used that calculate the balance, presenting the status as negative, positive or neutral.
The development took place following the best practices of clean code and division of responsibilities using ReactJS with TypeScript.
